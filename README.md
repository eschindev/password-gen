# Password Generator

This is a simple password generator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## About

I created this project to learn some basic JavaScript functionality. The password generator allows users to generate random passwords with customizable length and character sets.

## Usage

To use the password generator, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can click the "Generate Password" button to initiate a series of prompts that will allow you to set password length and included character sets, and a password will be generated in plaintext for you to copy and use as needed.
